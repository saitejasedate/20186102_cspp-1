'''
Write a python program to calculate the first 26 Fibonacci numbers and assign 
each Fibonacci number a letter in English by using Dictionaries.
(Keys as English alphabets and Values as Fibonacci numbers). Given a string as
input and calculate the sum of all the values of the characters that are associated with the
Fibonacci numbers from the given string. Write a function for finding the Fibonacci
numbers.
