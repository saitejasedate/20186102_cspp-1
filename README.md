CSPP - 1

In this course, students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. It covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, It introduces the concepts of Object Oriented Programming which help to solve complex programs easily. The goal of this course is to introduce hands-on experience on python and use that to solve complex problems in computer science.
